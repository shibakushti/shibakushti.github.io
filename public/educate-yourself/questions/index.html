<p><em>u/InThePortalAgain</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Generally if a project advertises flashy user interfaces and videos without substance such as thoughtful whitepapers and substantial evidence of real development, I get very suspicious. If a token has built in protocols to make it more difficult to sell to discourage selloffs I get suspicious. Any kind of artificial token burn to inflate market cap I get suspicious. Percentage returns that make seem out of this world I get suspicious.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>None of these things are certain indicators but they should set off alarm bells.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>u/KuantumWinter</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Does it look too good to be true? Then probably it is. Is the number of tokens very high with the promise of burning a large percentage of them? Then why create that many to begin with?</li>
</ul>
<p><em>u/Chooknwalrus</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Do the founders have a long online proven presence? Git-Hub LinkedIn etc. Does the project have open-source code to view? Not just marketing noise. What have I learned? Initially be skeptical of any project. DYOR to determine your own perspective. Always DYOR before investing.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>u/DoubleJuggle</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Risk to reward! Figure out what you can risk before you even find an investment. Do not figure this out on the fly when you are excited about a project. Know what you can afford to risk and stick to it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>High risk should have high reward potential. That is a low market cap with room to grow in the existing space, good regular daily volume, and good well thought out ideas and marketing behind it. You should see a short or long term future you think the project can go into.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do your own research only goes so far. You do not know what the dev community is like and most likely never will. The best projects can fail and a joke can win. Don’t forget that Blizzard entertainment seemed like a great bet on paper a little bit ago!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lastly if you or anyone else asks if it’s to late to get in… yeah it’s too late. Look at big pictures and enter on low rsi and bolinger band bottoms. There is no rush for you to get into any project. Take your dam time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>u/FlounderNo642</em></p>
<p><strong>What questions do new users need to ask?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What is a liquidity pool? What is the purpose/benefit of providing liquidy to a pool? How is rewards distribution calculated?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What do they need to look out for?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Swap Fees. Volatility in a trading pair. How market prices impact Stable pairs vs nonstable pairs. Transactions can take time to process and sometimes restarting your browser and/or computer helps. Understanding APY vs APR.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clear directions on providing liquidity, for example: swapping coins to provide pool ratio, depositing coin on the dex, staking LP tokens for rewards. Status on the wallet, what do they mean? What is slippage and how to adjust it? What is a miner fee?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How do they assess risk?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Utility of the governance token ( if any ). The concept of impermanence loss needs to be made clear to the participants. How secure is the Dex, making it very clear that if it&rsquo;s hacked there is a risk of losing assets. Vesting Periods on Rewards. How long is the team/sponsor liquidy locked for?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What have you learned in your experience with cryptocurrencies?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fees can add up overtimes. Blue-chip (Ergo-ADA) LP pairs can be agnostic and can provide liquidy to many dexes. As Ergodex grows and partners with other dexs and farms, these concepts are important to understand. Staking rewards and LP rewards can be compounded over time but are subject to taxes based on your country. Do not chase APY.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>u/BakAttakDisease</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Slow down. When you find out about a new project don’t invest at all or only with a very small amount like 3-5 dollars. Take things slow for anything new. You will make wiser decisions and you will achieve the best opportunities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The opportunities are only there if you are slow and methodical. There’s no need to rush since opportunities are always popping up and will give you time to warm up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TLDR: The best advice is to slow down. Almost all scams and gambles gone wrong happen in the moment. Just remember time is on your side.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>u/Funguyguy</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I think the biggest fear for anyone delving into defi is, is this token or farm susceptible to a rugpull? And to answer such a question someone or many someone’s with programming experience needs to review the smart contracts for back doors and burn wallets to make sure tokens really are burned when said.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For those that aren’t programmers, which is likely the majority, knowing how to identify what projects have been certified by trusted third party organizations for back doors and potential security holes is key to understanding risk before interacting with new tokens/projects.</p>
</li>
</ul>
