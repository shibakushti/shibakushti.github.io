    <p>A pump and dump scheme involves buying a low-market cap asset and later inflating the asset’s price. Investors usually artificially inflate the price of a crypto asset and sell it to unsuspecting investors, right before the asset suddenly crashes. Often, the promise of high returns from these schemes attracts inexperienced traders. These traders are left counting their losses, once the crypto asset crashes, as planned by the pump and dump group.</p>
<p>The investors will then buy the coin and create a buzz in the community for the new currency. These investors, also called whales, will use social media platforms to sell the idea of the new coin to unsuspecting new investors. Once they have a fair amount of the crypto, they bring in new investors who then raise the coin’s price by causing a purchasing frenzy.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Remember: Creators of a token can also run a similar scheme, with volume being the goal, not just price. They will create the tokens and need to unload them, rather than sell only sell one a day for $2 each, they look to sell a million for $1 in a few days</em></li>
