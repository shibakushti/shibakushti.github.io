## A list of tactics used to try scam you out of your tokens

*Remember: if it's too good to be true, it most likely is!*

## Youtube
Another common tactic is fake giveaways, in which you send tokens first, and will receive 2x, 5x, 10x etc. back. This is made to look legitimate, with an Authority Figure (the following example is just a random video of Hoskinson), Social Proof (It looks like lots of people are currently watching and liked the stream, however this is all bots). You will never receive tokens back, once you send them, they are gone. 

- *Remember: There is no case where you will receive more tokens if you send some first*

## Telegram & Discord
Scammers will wait for you to ask for help with an issue and then message you first pretending to be support, often trying to get you to give up your seed phrase which is all they need to restore your wallet, then send all your coins to the scammers address.

- *Remember: Admins and Support will never message you first*

### Example

A message from an account looking like Ergo Platform Support:

When actually it's a scammer with no association to Ergo:

## General

Fake websites and social media channels pretending to be Ergo, always go directly to the main site, never through a link: https://ergoplatform.org
