## Keep your recovery phrase in a secure offline location

When you create a wallet on Daedalus you will receive a recovery phrase, this is a list of 24-words that are used to generate the private key to access your funds. Anyone who has your recovery phrase can access your funds and create transactions, so you must keep it safe and secure. This is of crucial importance!

- Create your wallets ONLY on a trusted system

- Write your recovery phrase on a piece of PAPER and store it in a safe place

- **NEVER** take a photo of your recovery phrase or store your recovery phrase digitally on your devices or in cloud-based services

- **NEVER** share your recovery phrase with anyone. Not even with ERGO.

- **NEVER** input your recovery phrase on a website

- Make sure that NOBODY IS LOOKING at your screen when you use your recovery phrase to restore your wallet

- IF YOU LOSE YOUR RECOVERY PHRASE, create a new wallet and transfer your funds immediately. You should not be using a wallet for which you do not have the recovery phrase.


## Never use wallets on a shared or public computer

- Shared computers might be already compromised. Using Wallets in a shared or public computer carries several threats to your information and funds. Just don’t do it


## Use a strong spending password

When creating and restoring wallets you are required to set a spending password. This password is used to encrypt/decrypt your private key, Wallets ask for it when you send transactions. We encourage you to:

- Have a password that uses a combination of words, numbers, symbols, spaces, and both upper- and lower-case letters.

- Have a password of at least 10 characters, Wallets generally can take up to 255 characters, use it. If your computer gets compromised, a strong password might be your last line of defense.

- Using an encrypted password manager is a good idea. These tools, apart from generating strong and random passwords, can help to protect you against keyloggers since you will never need to type your password on the keyboard.

- If possible, use a hardware wallet in combination with Wallets. This way the confirmation process happens on the device, which is a safer place than your computer. You still need to use a PIN or passphrase on your device but it is out of the reach of any malware installed on your computer.

*Note that this password ONLY works to encrypt/decrypt your private key on the computer where your wallet is restored. Anyone with access to the recovery phrase can restore the wallet on a different machine and set a different spending password on that. So keeping your recovery phrase secure is vital.*

## Be careful where you click

- Avoid untrusted and unknown websites. Dangerous websites can host malware that automatically installs on your computer and compromises it.

- If attachments or links in email messages are unexpected or suspicious for any reason, don't click on them.


## Be careful of phishing

- Cyber-criminals will attempt to make you reveal information using a variety of social engineering tricks. Never disclose any private information by phone, text, social networks, email, or apps.

- Usually, a phishing scam is initiated by an email that has the appearance of official business and requests that you perform an urgent action, such as “Download the latest version now”, “You have 5 minutes to register for a giveaway“, “Urgent, you need to validate your wallet’s data”.

- Do not fall for these types of scams. ERGO, IOHK, EMURGO, or the CARDANO FOUNDATION will never send these emails.

## Keep your system updated.

- Install all software and security updates for your operating system.

- urn on Automatic Updates for your operating system.

- Use web browsers that receive frequent, automatic security updates.

- Uninstall any browser plugins that are not absolutely necessary.

- It is very easy to get unintended plugins installed on your computer. Make sure to routinely review which plugins are installed and immediately remove any that you do not recognize.


## Never discuss your cryptocurrency holdings

- Never talk about your crypto holdings with anyone that does not specifically have a need-to-know (spouse, taxes, etc.). Advertising this only makes you a bigger target.
